This script will download a payload you have put on a webserver to the person inserting the arduino into their computer (Only for windows, because it  uses powershell)


If you want it to work with wan you can do it by ngrok.

I am not responsible for anything you do with this

The troll version will execute some random stuff and open never gonna give you up
In order to use this on your Arduino you need to have "HID-PROJECT" 

To find this in your Arduino IDE go to tools on the top and click manage libraries. Then click the search bar and search "HID-PROJECT"
